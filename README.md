# Red-Wine-Quality
The dataset contains details about samples of wine and different features accounting for the concentrations of the different chemicals in  the wine. The target variable is the quality of the wine on a scale of 0-10. First of all, EDA is performed and visualized using pandas,matplotlib,seaborn library but there are no missing values found. Then I have scaled the data using Standardscaler, and prepare it for modelling. I have used different ML algorithms from the scikit learn including Logistic Regresion, RandomForest,KNN.  I have also tuned the hyper parameters of all the algorithms using the GridSearchCV function.  After all, I got an accuracy of 0.9125 on the dataset by using a Random Forest
